							<p>Hi, my name is Britney. I've been happily married for 32 years and blessed with two wonderful children and three gorgeous grandkids. </p>
							<p>Recently, I discovered a way to <b>regain my former self. </b>
							</p>
							<p>I still remember when I was in my 20s and 30s, and...
							</p>
							<ul class="list-about">
								<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>had plenty of energy</li>
								<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>maintained a slim figure</li>
								<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>could eat whatever I wanted</li>
							</ul>
							<p>However, somewhere in my early 40s, everything changed.

						<h2>After Turning 40, Things Started to Go Downhill... FAST!

					</div>
					<div class="big-content">
						<p>After turning 40, I noticed that my once slim and petite appearance had started to bulge in unwanted areas.</p>
						<p>My metabolism seemed to have slowed down significantly, and my health had also started to deteriorate.</p>
						<p>I had very little energy throughout the day, and would often go to bed early and sleep for 12 hours straight. Yet to wake up and still feel exhausted the next day.</p>
						<p>I knew something was wrong. But I didn't realize how BAD things were, until I stepped on a scale during a holiday trip to California with my husband.</p>
						<p><b>The scale showed <u>237!</u></b></p>
						<p>Something must be "Off", I thought... the hotel must have missed to calibrate the scale or something... that number just couldn't be right.</p>
						<p>But no matter how often I stepped on and off that scale... the number didn't change.</p>
						<p>And slowly I came to realize that the only one being "Off" for all those years... was ME.</p>
						<p>I was <b>SHOCKED....</b> and so, so embarrassed.</p>
						<p>How could I let this happen to myself?!</p>
						<p>I used to be so careful...</p>
						<p>But somewhere along the way through two pregnancies and a full-time job, I lost sight of myself and my health.</p>
						<p>That night I made a decision to <b>get my health back under control.</b></p>

								<p>When I got home, I immediately started walking to improve my health.</p>
								<p>However, I quickly realized that my joints couldn't handle the extra weight I was carrying.</p>
								<p>So, I decided to try a detox plan with smoothies and juicing.</p>
								<p>At first, this seemed to be successful.</p>
								<p>But I found that the detox left me feeling excessively hungry, which led to binge snacking at night and ultimately derailed my progress.</p>

								<p>I also tried foot detox pads and sleeping with a <b>raw onion in my socks!</b></p>
								<p>(OMG, I'm flushing right now admitting this here üôÉ).</p>
								<p>None of these remedies seemed to work, and I was still struggling to regain my health and my former self...</p>

								<p>Next, I tried the keto diet, which had some tasty meals, but made me miss bread.</p>
								<p>I also tried calorie counting, the paleo diet, and even became vegan for a month, but my weight just wasn't changing.</p>
								<p>I began to <b>wonder if there was something wrong with me</b> internally, so I made an appointment with my doctor for a check-up.</p>

								<p>My doctor reassured me that there was nothing wrong with me and that my <b>weight gain</b> over the years <b>had nothing to do with my diet or exercise habits</b>.</p>

								<p>"I recently joined a medical conference and came across an <b>interesting new morning routine</b>" he started...</p>
								<p>"This method may seem a little unconventional, but it is supported by scientific research. It's referred to as <b><u>10-Second Juice Fix</u></b> and you do it every morning...</p>

					<p><p>I assumed he was going to recommend some type of supplement or medication, but I was mistaken.</p>
					<p>Instead, he went on rhapsodizing about the amazing benefits to using this fix:</p></p>
					<ul class="list-about">
						<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> I didn't have to change my eating habits</li>
						<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> I didn't have to exercise anymore</li>

							<div class="center-image">
								<img src="images/juiceTweak-min.png" alt="">

							<div class="mar-both">
								<p>Then he handed me a piece of paper with the website address to a video.</p>
								<p>I was so excited to find out about this odd morning routine, that I pulled out my phone right there in the doctor's parking lot to see what his little secret was all about</p>
								<p>...and as I watched it <b>my jaw dropped!</b></p>
								<p>Thousands of men and women had already used what they called a <u><b>"Fizzy Juice"</b></u> to drop inches and get back in shape</p>
								<p>‚Ä¶ and no matter how skeptical I was at first, I couldn‚Äôt deny what was right in front of me.</p>
								<p>I had some doubts, but my heart was telling me that <b>this was the answer I had been <u>looking for all my life!</u></b></p>
								<p>So I decided to follow my heart and give it a try.</p>

								<p>So, I've been using this 10-Second Juice Fix for almost six months now and I'm extremely HAPPY with the results.</p>
								<p>Just as my doctor predicted, I saw <b>improvements almost IMMEDIATELY.</b></p>
								<p>The numbers on the scale started to drop on the second day, and have continued to do so.</p>
								<p><b>No more yo-yoing back</b> anymore!</p>
								<p>I have been able to replace part of my wardrobe every other week as I continue to lose weight.</p>
								<p>I still can't believe it when I find myself shopping in the women's petite section instead of the plus size section.</p>

						<h2>I'm So Thankful I Followed My Heart... And Not My Head

					<p>I could have easily ignored my doctor's suggestion to try this unusual morning routine, but I decided to set aside my skepticism and give it a try.</p>
					<p>As a result, <b>I feel like my TRUE SELF</b> again and I'm confident in my future health.</p>
					<p>I'm so happy I took some time out of my very busy day to learn about this ancient calorie-burning technique and watch the video he recommended.</p>
					<p>Who would have thought?!</p>
					<p>The positive changes happened so fast that more and more people are asking me about my "secret".</p>
					<p>So, I provided a link to the website my doctor recommended me below. That is... </p>
					<p><b>... if it's STILL up.</b></p>
					<p>I was told that there are some pending legal actions from a few well-known pharmaceutical companies who are trying to keep this video <b>hidden from the general public.</b></p>
					<p>To be sure you have the chance to <b>watch the video</b> and learn about this <b>Fizzy Juice Fix</b>, it may be a good idea to follow the link now and watch the video right away. üëá</p>
					<p>I <b><u>promise</u></b> you will not regret this.</p>
					<p>If I can do it, everybody can!</p>
